<p id="description">This is the official repository for the Galactic Hacks Hackathon 2k23 JUET. This project is developed using Cobra and Viper command line utilities with Go Programming language and it is a dynamic Command line tool that validates the email user provides to it as an argumnet and ensures it's existential values.<br><br>
Our project is about ensuring the validation of email provided by the user. If the mail domain service provider is accurate then the tool fetches all the details of the email domain. Even if the email provided by the user is invalid, then also our tool is able to provide the details of the provided email domain.<br> 
This tool is built for open source and is free of cost for lifetime free use.<br> 
Go being a simple and multipurpose language is used as a backend application for our project. React being a component based programming language is used for frontend.</p>
<p id="description"><b>Why Go?</b>
<br>
Go is a simple language that is easy to learn, and is a multipurpose language which made it suitable for backend in our project.<br>
 The syntax of Golang is relatively small and has been used for a long time without significant changes.<br> <br>
This tool ensures user friendliness by releasing all major platform supported executables and is powered by the Cobra CLI Generation utlity and Viper wrapper by https://github.com/spf13
