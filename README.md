# GalacticHacks
This is my official repository for the Galactic Hacks Hackathon 2k23 JUET.
The project is developed by Team Pegasus Gliders. This project is bootstrapped using Create React App command and Go language and it is a dynamic React based Web application that validates the email and ensures it's existence.

Why Go?
Go is a simple language that is easy to learn, and is a multipurpose language which made it suitable for backend in our project. The syntax of Golang is relatively small and has been used for a long time without significant changes. 
React being a component based programming language is used for frontend. It offers developers an easy way to create applications with a lot of functionality at once. It helped in creating dynamic web pages.
